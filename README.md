AI Startups in the GPT Era
==========================

What businesses are enabled by the transformers era[^0]?

It's clear that we have new tools at our disposal. What those tools are good for, what business models can produce, scale, and capture value from themâ€”much less clear.

Good news! That's what startups are for[^1]. Here is a list of them. Editorial judgment has been applied, especially for new AI (in) vs GOFML (out). It omits robotics (unclear impact beyond CNNs), biotech (outside my expertise), pure infrastructure (selling compute is selling compute), and silicon (ditto). It omits side projects, research collectives, academic demos, etc. It applies a vague Wikipedia-style notability threshold. **Incomplete and subject to change.**
