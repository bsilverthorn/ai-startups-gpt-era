AI Startups in the GPT Era
==========================

What businesses are enabled by this new era[^0]?

It's clear that we have new tools at our disposal. What those tools are good
for, what business models can produce, scale, and capture value from them—much
less clear.

Good news! That's what startups are for. Here is a semi-curated list of **use
cases** explored by AI startups.

Editorial judgment has been applied to (try to) exclude `.ai` rebrands,
old-fashioned SaaS+ML, and so forth. It also omits robotics (unclear impact
IMO), biotech (outside my expertise), pure infrastructure (selling compute is
selling compute), and silicon (ditto). It mostly omits side projects, research
collectives, academic demos, etc. Focused on semi-actual businesses, e.g.,
applies a vague Wikipedia-style notability threshold and ignores most Product
Hunt MVPs. **Incomplete and subject to change.** File an issue if you want
something added or fixed.
